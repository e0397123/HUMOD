# HUMOD
HUMOD dataset is a high-quality human annotated movie dialogue dataset. 
This new dataset comprises 28,500 human responses from 9,500 multi-turn dialogue history-reply pairs.
Human responses include: (i) ratings of the dialogue reply in relevance to the dialogue history; 
and (ii) unique dialogue replies for each dialogue history from the users. 
Such unique dialogue replies enable researchers in evaluating their models against six unique human responses 
for each given history. Each column is separated with a tab. "User Reply" column is the human generated reply for given dialogue context. "User Relevance Score" column is the human score reply for given "Dialogue Context" and "Reply".
